### Layer-Specific GCode Editor for Resuming Failed 3D Prints

The intitial GCode file is generated by slicing a 3D model in the cura slicer. 

This is a program designed to edit GCode for 3D printing. It allows the user to change the coordinates from a selected layer to the print bed by altering the z coordinates and extruder coordinates. Two inputs are required: the layer until which the print is completed and the file location. This program is useful for continuing failed prints due to loss of connection between the octoprint and the 3D printer. The idea behind this program is to provide an easy solution for anyone who encounters this issue.
